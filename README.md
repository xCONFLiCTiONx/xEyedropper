#### What is xEyedroper

xEyedropper is mainly for developers and especially handy for website developers. You can grab the color from a pixel anywhere one your screen by hovering the mouse over the pixel and left clicking. The color will go into the clipboard for pasting with the choice of HTML Hex or RGB.

You can also edit the color with the color dialog editor or save the color for later use. You can create your own color too which will be in the clipboard once you're done editing. Do I really need to tell you how much time this can save you not to mention the accuracy of color you'll have? I'm betting not!
